# Auctioneer
Host your own auction!

This small project came out of a visit to a silent auction where everything was done on paper, and I saw room for improvement. Just a proof of concept and a work in progress.

# Setup
1. Run `npm run server`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. In a browser, go to `localhost:3001` to see items up for auction

If you open two browser windows, each will be assigned a random username (which you can change) to keep track of bids. If you bid in one window and refresh the other, you'll see the bids update. Outbid each other!
