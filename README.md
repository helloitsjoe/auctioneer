# Auctioneer
Host your own auction

This small project came out of a visit to a silent auction where everything was done on paper, and I saw room for improvement. Work in progress!

# Setup
1. Run `npm run server`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. In a browser, go to `localhost:3001` to see items up for auction
