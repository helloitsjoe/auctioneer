# Auctioneer
## Host your own auction!

This small project came out of a visit to a silent auction where everything was done on paper, and I saw room for improvement. Proof of concept/work in progress.

# Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. In a separate terminal, `npm run server` (Includes IP address for bidding on a mobile device)
4. In a browser, go to `localhost:3001` to see items up for auction

Each browser window will be assigned a random username (which you can change) to keep track of bids. Outbid each other!
