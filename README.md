# Auctioneer
Host your own auction!

This small project came out of a visit to a silent auction where everything was done on paper, and I saw room for improvement. This is just a proof of concept and a work in progress!

# Setup
1. Run `npm run server`
2. Run `npm run start`
3. In a browser, go to `localhost:3001` to see items up for auction

You are assigned a default username, which you can change in the input field. The auction will use your username to keep track of your bids. If you open a second window, you'll see a new user's bids. If another user updates, refresh to see the updated auction info.
